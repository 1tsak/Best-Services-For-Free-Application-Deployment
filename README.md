# Free services to deploy your front-end and full-stack applications.


In this repository you will find some of the top hosting options for static or dynamic full-stack web applications, all of which are free to use.


All of the websites listed below offer both a paid and a free tier; you can utilise the free tier to host your own personal projects and switch to the appropriate paid plan whenever you require additional resources.


Heroku used to be the go-to, cost-free provider for amateurs and beginners to deploy simple apps for learning and concept testing.


Heroku will stop offering free plans starting on November 28.
Here, I've included a list of various totally free services where you may deploy your front-end and full-stack applications.


## 1) Vercel
Vercel is a platform for static sites and frontend frameworks, built to integrate with your headless content, commerce, or database.

## 2) Netlify
Netlify is another very popular website for hosting your dynamic and static websites, but it only supports the front end, so you can't host full stack applications on Netlify.
The deployment process is also very simple with Netlify; it's almost the same as with Vercel.


* Go to https://www.netlify.com/
* Sign Up with your github account
* Click on "add new site and select import existing project." There is also an option to choose from available templates, or you can also upload your site manually.
* Click on the import button next to your GitHub repository, which contains the project you want to deploy .
* A popup will appear where you can configure things like project directory root name, etc.
